# About me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hi, I am Gleb Smirnov, 16 y.o. software developer who really want to make this world better.</br>
I love Open Source, programming and tea. I am Linux and GNOME fan.

# My skills

**Fun fact about me:** I'm 5 years in programming, but I believe that my birth as software developer is 2021 year.
It's when I started to create real projects, contribute to other projects and develop my skills.

## Python

I practice Python for 5 years.

I can write GUI apps in Python via Tkinter, PyQt5, GTK.

I tried myself in writing Telegram bots. My goal was creating a bot which will execute some common Unix commands (like `sed` and `awk`) right on messages.
But I couldn't solve some security problems, which I think I can solve now, but now I have no server to host this bot.

I was developing simple tank game using Pygame with my friend:

<a/><br/><br/>

I developed yet another game using Pygame, but it's the simplest platformer-shooter ever developed in three days in my free time
from nothing-to-do on holydays. It's not really finished game project, it's just playable MVP. I am not going to continue it's development.
