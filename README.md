# About me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hi, I am Gleb Smirnov, 16 y.o. software developer who really want to make this world better.</br>
I love Open Source, programming and tea. I am Linux and GNOME fan.

I live in Moscow, Russia.

# My skills

  **Fun fact about me:** I'm 5 years in programming, but I believe that my birth as software developer is January of 2021. It's when I started to create real projects, contribute to other projects and develop my sklls.

## Python

I practice Python for 5 years.

I can write GUI apps in Python via Tkinter, PyQt5, GTK.

I tried myself in writing Telegram bots. My goal was creating a bot which will execute some common Unix commands (like `sed` and `awk`) right on messages.
But I couldn't solve some security problems, which I think I can solve now, but now I have no server to host this bot.

<a/><br/><br/>

I was developing simple tank game using Pygame with my friend:

<a/><br/><br/>

I developed yet another game using Pygame, but it's the simplest platformer-shooter ever developed in three days in my free time
from nothing-to-do on holydays. It's not really finished game project, it's just playable MVP. I am not going to continue it's development.

<a/><br/><br/>

I also contributed to some GTK Python project, such as [Meowgram](https://github.com/ExposedCat/Meowgram) and [Lollypop](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/lollypop)

## GTK and GNOME

I develop applications for GNOME platform using GTK since January of 2021.

My first gnomish project is Text Pieces, text transformation app inspired by Boop:

<a/><br/><br/>

I worked a little bit on [Meowgram](https://github.com/ExposedCat/Meowgram), GTK Telegram client written in Python.
Also I did some little contributions in GTK itself and Libadwaita, UI library for GNOME built on top of GTK.

## Vala

I initially started writting [Text Pieces](https://github.com/liferooter/textpieces) in Rust, but almost immediately switched to Vala because it's more high-level than Rust and can be easily used with GTK because it's built with GLib.
  
I really love this language. It's as high-level as C# and as fast as C. Vala has one really good feature: library written in Vala can be used from a lot of languages without writting bindings manually via [GObject Introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Now I work on [telegram-glib](https://gitlab.gnome.org/liferooter/telegram-glib), TDLib-based Telegram API library written in Vala. Work is in progress now, but when it will be done, a lot of languages will get good Telegram API library that is based on official TDLib and will support all TDLib's features.

## Linux

I use Linux for two years. I used Linux Mint, Gentoo Linux, Arch Linux, Ubuntu, NixOS and Fedora. I have some experience of Linux setting up. Now I use Fedora Linux with GNOME.
  
I develop software for Linux. I have no (and won't have) computers with Windows and macOS. I believe that operating system **MUST** be open-source. Your computer shouldn't run arbitary code got from Microsoft or Apple as OS core. I believe that properietary software makes users non-free.

# Ask me about

Feel free to ask me about Linux, GNOME, GTK, Python, Vala and Open Source.
  
I am open for new Open Source projects. Contributions to my projects are also wellcomed.
